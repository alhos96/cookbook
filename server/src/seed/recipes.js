    ingredients: [" asparagus", "olive oil", "kosher salt"],
    instructions:
      'Preheat oven to 425°F.Cut off the woody bottom part of the asparagus spears and discard. With a vegetable peeler, peel off the skin on the bottom 2-3 inches of the spears (this keeps the asparagus from being all.",string.", and if you eat asparagus you know what I mean by that). Place asparagus on foil-lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil.Sprinkle with salt. With your hands, roll the asparagus around until they are evenly coated with oil and salt. Roast for 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of your stalks and how tender you like them.  They should be tender when pierced with the tip of a knife.The tips of the spears will get very brown but watch them to prevent burning. They are great plain, but sometimes I serve them with a light vinaigrette if we need something acidic to balance out our meal.',
